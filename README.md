# WarehouseAgents

As of today, 26/01/2024, the repository is at version 1.0. It includes a working version of the WarehouseAgents model, with a functioning logic driven model and a semi-functioning BID model. 

More changes are to be expected, such as:


-Changing the path choosing algorithm for a more complicated one

-Ensuring that the agents do not collide with each other

-Adding extra stacks to store the boxes in, each created by the Robot agent.
